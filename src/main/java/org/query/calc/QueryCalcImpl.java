        First, I'm going to assume that each table contains n rows. The problem description doesnt say anything about
        this. In the real world, its possible to implement multiple strategies and then apply them depending on the data
        characteristics.

        There is a  join on 2 sides of a < b+c. Left side contains n rows while the right side contains n*n rows.
        There are 2 options of how they can be implemented:

        1. For every element on the right, find all a's such as a<b+c. Accumulate x*y*z in each a. This computation will
        take O(n*n*n). Sorting t1 by a isn't going to help all that much since we would still need to scan O(n) rows
        in t1 (a < b+c). Then, we would scan t1 and find top10. So, its O(n^3)

        2. Compute t2 join t3 in ram. (Store only {b+c, y*z}). Sort by b+c, iterate from the top and keep the running
        sum. Replace b*c with the sum(b*c) for such b,c that b+c > the given b+c

        3. Read t1 and store it in a hashmap with a as a key. For value of a, lookup b+c which are greater than a and
        sum precomputed xyz. Store these sums in the hashtable along with the row number for the first given value of a

        4.  Find top 10 in the hashtable using a sorted container. Use row number from the original table to break ties.

        ToDo:
        - more testing and some benchmarking

        More optimization opportunities:
        I use standard Java containers here to store objects which contain either 2 doubles or a double and an integer.
        This will incure a pretty significant cost of an object pointers and pointer indirection. Also, this will not
        be good for the CPU cash. We should look into using a different language or may be some sort of a native
        memory allocation technique

        I'm pretty sure, many operations here could be parallelized. May be by using streams library. It could also
        be done manually.
